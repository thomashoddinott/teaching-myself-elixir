We can make an Elixir project with `mix`, providing all the components we need if we were to compile an app.

Mix comes with elixir, try `mix --version` to double check whether it's there.

For example:

```powershell
C:\Users\Thomas\git\teaching-myself-elixir\learn-elixir-in-one-video [master ≡ +4 ~2 -0 !]> mix new elixir_demo
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/elixir_demo.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/elixir_demo_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd elixir_demo
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
